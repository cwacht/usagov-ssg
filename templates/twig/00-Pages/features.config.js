Buyers line up at the register with heart-shaped boxes of chocolate, and keep florists busy juggling orders for beautiful bouquets. It&rsquo;s all part of the excitement and romance of Valentine&rsquo;s Day. But for someone who&rsquo;s recovering from sexual assault or living with domestic violence, all of the cards and roses in the world can&rsquo;t make up for the pain.<\/p><p>If you want to support a friend in this difficult situation, or if you need support yourself, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usa.gov\/explore\/\">USAGov<\/a> has gathered these resources to help:<\/p><p><strong>When your friend needs you<\/strong><\/p><p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t know unless you&rsquo;ve been there.&rdquo; From the outside, it can be hard to understand why people hesitate to report a sexual assault or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.womenshealth.gov\/violence-against-women\/types-of-violence\/domestic-intimate-partner-violence.html#g\">stay in abusive relationships.<\/a> But there are a lot of reasons: fear that no one would believe them--especially if the attacker is respected in the community, concern for their own or their children&rsquo;s safety, financial instability, or feeling--because of the abuser&rsquo;s mind games--that they deserve the abuse. Learn how to help your friend move toward safety and healing with these <a href=\"http:\/\/womenshealth.gov\/violence-against-women\/get-help-for-violence\/how-to-help-a-friend-who-is-being-abused.html\">suggestions from WomensHealth.gov<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>When you&rsquo;re a bystander<\/strong><\/p><p>If you&rsquo;re a college student, you might have heard about sexual assaults on your campus. Some of those assaults may have been prevented if bystanders had spoken up. The <a href=\"http:\/\/itsonus.org\/\">It&rsquo;s On Us<\/a> campaign works to prevent sexual assault by changing the college culture. Its <a href=\"http:\/\/itsonus.org\/#tools\">tips and tools<\/a> teach you to trust that knot in your stomach when a situation doesn&rsquo;t seem right. It empowers you to move beyond being an observer to step in and help protect someone who&rsquo;s vulnerable or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notalone.gov\/students\/\">support a friend who&rsquo;s been assaulted<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>When you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s hurting<\/strong><\/p><p>Living through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.girlshealth.gov\/safety\/saferelationships\/daterape.html\">rape<\/a> or domestic violence can be isolating and shocking, and it can leave you wrapped in shame and hopelessness. Your partner may try to convince you that you&rsquo;re not really being abused, or that it&rsquo;s your fault. This list of <a href=\"http:\/\/womenshealth.gov\/violence-against-women\/am-i-being-abused\/index.html\">signs of abuse<\/a> can help you evaluate your relationship.<\/p><p>Even if you&rsquo;re not ready to make a report to the police, you can still begin <a href=\"http:\/\/www.womenshealth.gov\/violence-against-women\/get-help-for-violence\/safety-planning-for-abusive-situations.html\">creating a safety plan<\/a> to leave a dangerous situation. And you can reach out for non-judgmental support anonymously, day or night, from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thehotline.org\/\">National Domestic Violence Hotline<\/a> at 1-800-799-7233. You can also contact the <a href=\"https:\/\/rainn.org\/get-help\/national-sexual-assault-hotline\">National Sexual Assault Hotline<\/a> at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notalone.gov\/resources\/#find-a-service-near-you\">find a rape crisis center<\/a>&nbsp;near you. If possible, contact them from a phone or computer account that your abuser can&rsquo;t access so they won&rsquo;t be able to trace your call records or browsing history.<\/p><p>These organizations are ready to refer you to local help for counseling, treatment for stress, depression, or trauma, and housing and child care programs.

        "body": "<p>Managing your finances can be hard. Managing the finances of a relative or a friend &nbsp;can be even harder. You want to honor your loved one&rsquo;s wishes and respect his or her boundaries, but at the same time you need to act in his or her best interest. It can be hard to know where to begin or whom to trust. Not only are there legal obligations that come with this responsibility, but the added emotional stress of caring for a family member or friend &nbsp;can feel overwhelming.<\/p><p>So let&rsquo;s start with the basics: What is a power of attorney? What does it mean for you, and what should you look out for? Being informed, prepared, and alert will help make a difficult situation as comfortable as possible for all &nbsp;involved.<\/p><h3>Be Informed: What Is a Power of Attorney?<\/h3><p>A power of attorney is a written document in which one person gives legal authority to another to make decisions about his or her money or property. If you&rsquo;ve been named to manage money or property for someone else under a power of attorney, you are the <strong>fiduciary<\/strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re managing a small amount of money or a lot, or if you&rsquo;re a family member or not &ndash; you&rsquo;re now legally responsible for managing &nbsp;that money or property for the benefit of that person, known as the <strong>principal<\/strong>.<\/p><p>If you were chosen as &nbsp;fiduciary, the principal sees you as a trustworthy, honest, and responsible person. Preparing yourself with the necessary information will help you manage your responsibilities and will bring you, and everyone involved, peace of mind. &nbsp;<\/p><h3>Be Prepared: Understanding Your Legal Duties<\/h3><p>While a power of attorney can seem like a complex document, there are really just four major duties you need to execute as fiduciary. Your legal responsibilities are to:<\/p><ul><li>Act only in the principal&rsquo;s best interest.<\/li><li>Manage money and property carefully.<\/li><li>Keep your money and property separate from the principal&rsquo;s.<\/li><li>Keep good records.<\/li><\/ul><p>Because you&rsquo;re managing someone else&rsquo;s money, your responsibility is to make decisions that are best for that person. This means managing the money carefully, using good judgment and common sense, and never mixing your assets with the other person&rsquo;s. Keeping true and complete records is important; incorrect or incomplete records can get you in trouble &mdash; not just with the principal, but also with the police and with government agencies, such as a city&rsquo;s or state&rsquo;s Adult Protective Services office.<\/p><h3>Be Alert: Protecting Your Loved Ones From Fraud<\/h3><p>Financial exploitation has been called &ldquo;the crime of the 21st &nbsp;century.&rdquo; As a fiduciary, you should know the signs of financial exploitation. Recognizing what to look for will help you protect both yourself and your loved one. Be wary if:<\/p><ul><li>You or your loved one thinks that money or property is missing.<\/li><li>Your loved one shows sudden changes in spending and saving behavior.<\/li><li>Your loved one puts names on bank accounts and property that can&rsquo;t be explained.<\/li><li>Your loved one fears a relative, caregiver, or friend.<\/li><li>A relative shows controlling behavior towards you or a loved one.<\/li><\/ul><p>Even if your loved one controls only some (or none) of his or her funds, he or she can still be exploited. If he or she was exploited in the past, before you become involved, there still may be something you can do about it&mdash;you can, for example, alert banks and credit card companies or talk to an attorney about preventing future exploitation and recovering the property that was taken.<\/p><p>The truth is, we&rsquo;re all at risk. Anyone with any money could be targeted by a fraudster at some point. But you can help protect your family and friends by recognizing how fraudsters operate and by reporting suspicious scams and suspicious sales pitches.<\/p>",

        "body": "<p>Today is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/campaigns\/world-health-day\/2016\/en\/\">World Health Day<\/a>, a time to learn more about diabetes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this disease affects one in 11 people in the United States. A quarter of those who have diabetes don&rsquo;t even know it.<\/p><p>It&rsquo;s possible to prevent or slow down the development of complications from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/medlineplus\/diabetes.html\">diabetes<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/medlineplus\/prediabetes.html\">prediabetes<\/a> by adopting an active and healthy lifestyle. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s important for people with the condition to get support from friends, family, and the community. These tips from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usa.gov\/\">USA.gov<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/diabeteshandsfoundation.org\/\">Diabetes Hands Foundation<\/a> can help you become more aware of the ways you can help friends and family living with diabetes.<\/p><p><strong>Stay informed<\/strong>. There&rsquo;s a lot of information about diabetes on the Internet, but it&rsquo;s important to choose sources that are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/diabetes\/home\/index.html\">trustworthy<\/a>. Staying informed about new medical advances, tests, medications, treatments, and the emotional aspects of life with diabetes can help you understand the specific needs of your loved one living with the condition.<\/p><p><strong>Share healthy meals<\/strong>. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/diabetes\/managing\/eatright.html\">healthy nutritional plan<\/a> can reduce the risk of diabetes, and help manage the condition in people who have it. Dietary improvements should not only interest and benefit the person with diabetes, but the entire family as well. Consider trying <a href=\"http:\/\/www.choosemyplate.gov\/recipes-cookbooks-and-menus\">healthy, balanced dishes<\/a> from other cultures. It can become an adventure for the whole family.<\/p><p><strong>Include physical activity<\/strong>. Walking, dancing, and bicycle riding are activities the entire family can enjoy. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nlm.nih.gov\/medlineplus\/ency\/patientinstructions\/000083.htm\">Physical exercise<\/a> helps reduce glucose concentrations in the blood and it&rsquo;s a good way to reduce or maintain your weight.

        "body": "<p><em>Dear Marietta,<\/em><\/p><p><em>I love doing my holiday shopping online so I can avoid the long lines at the mall and try to score some good sales, but with all the news of hackers stealing credit card information lately, I&#39;m nervous this year. What can I do to keep my information safe?<\/em><\/p><p><em>A Cautious Consumer<\/em><\/p><h3>Marietta&#39;s answer:<\/h3><p>Hi Cautious!<\/p><p>This is a great question. We love the convenience of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onguardonline.gov\/articles\/0020-shopping-online\">online shopping<\/a>, but we definitely don&rsquo;t want to face the potential aggravation of hacked accounts that could result. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no 100% failproof solution. But there are some things you can do to protect yourself during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales and beyond.<\/p><p>First things first: before you submit any payment information, make sure you&rsquo;re on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.us-cert.gov\/ncas\/tips\/ST04-013\">secure website<\/a>. The URL on the payment screen should have &ldquo;https&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;http.&rdquo; Also, if you&rsquo;re shopping on a wireless network, make sure it&rsquo;s secure, and protected by a password.<\/p><p>In terms of the payment method, avoid using your checking account or debit card. If your account information or card is stolen, a hacker could wipe out all the money in your account. A good thing about credit cards is that you are only liable for a maximum of $50 for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.consumer.ftc.gov\/articles\/0213-lost-or-stolen-credit-atm-and-debit-cards#Limit\">fraudulent charges<\/a>. You may also be able to add extra security features on a credit card. For instance, some card issuers offer text message verifications. Immediately after a transaction happens, you&rsquo;ll receive a text message to allow you to confirm that it&rsquo;s legit, and not a fraud. And some card issuers have implemented two-factor authentication for online purchases. After you submit your payment information, you&rsquo;ll receive an email or text message with a one-time use code. To complete the transaction, you&rsquo;ll enter that code on their website to confirm that it&rsquo;s really you making the purchase.<\/p><p>You could also use an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/blogs\/online-payment-services\">online payment service<\/a>, which would be connected to your credit card or bank account. If the retailer you&rsquo;re shopping with accepts that online payment service, you can make your transaction through it, and not share your credit card or bank account information directly with the retailer.<\/p><p>And if you don&rsquo;t want to deal with any of this, you could always buy gift cards and use them to shop online. Just remember not to throw them away after you&rsquo;ve used them, in case you need to return or exchange any of the gifts you buy with them.<\/p><p><em>Marietta Jelks is the editor of the <a href=\"\/handbook\">Consumer Action Handbook<\/a>, where you can find more information on keeping your money safe, avoiding scams and fraud and more.

We love the convenience of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onguardonline.gov\/articles\/0020-shopping-online\">online shopping<\/a>, but we definitely don&rsquo;t want to face the potential aggravation of hacked accounts that could result. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no 100% failproof solution. But there are some things you can do to protect yourself during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales and beyond.<\/p><p>First things first: before you submit any payment information, make sure you&rsquo;re on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.us-cert.gov\/ncas\/tips\/ST04-013\">secure website<\/a>. The URL on the payment screen should have &ldquo;https&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;http.&rdquo; Also, if you&rsquo;re shopping on a wireless network, make sure it&rsquo;s secure, and protected by a password.<\/p><p>In terms of the payment method, avoid using your checking account or debit card. If your account information or card is stolen, a hacker could wipe out all the money in your account. A good thing about credit cards is that you are only liable for a maximum of $50 for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.consumer.ftc.gov\/articles\/0213-lost-or-stolen-credit-atm-and-debit-cards#Limit\">fraudulent charges<\/a>. You may also be able to add extra security features on a credit card. For instance, some card issuers offer text message verifications. Immediately after a transaction happens, you&rsquo;ll receive a text message to allow you to confirm that it&rsquo;s legit, and not a fraud. And some card issuers have implemented two-factor authentication for online purchases. After you submit your payment information, you&rsquo;ll receive an email or text message with a one-time use code. To complete the transaction, you&rsquo;ll enter that code on their website to confirm that it&rsquo;s really you making the purchase.<\/p><p>You could also use an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/blogs\/online-payment-services\">online payment service<\/a>, which would be connected to your credit card or bank account. If the retailer you&rsquo;re shopping with accepts that online payment service, you can make your transaction through it, and not share your credit card or bank account information directly with the retailer.<\/p><p>And if you don&rsquo;t want to deal with any of this, you could always buy gift cards and use them to shop online. Just remember not to throw them away after you&rsquo;ve used them, in case you need to return or exchange any of the gifts you buy with them.<\/p><p><em>Marietta Jelks is the editor of the <a href=\"\/handbook\">Consumer Action Handbook<\/a>, where you can find more information on keeping your money safe, avoiding scams and fraud and more.
